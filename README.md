What does a 'like' mean to you?
How do we make the like button more genuine?
At HackDartmouth 2015, we designed and developed the front-end of SmileToLike,
a web application that brings more human emotion to the "like" button on Instagram 
by using a webcam and emotion recognition. 

The application is built with Indico.io and Instagram APIs,
along with Python, Flask, Webcam.js, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
